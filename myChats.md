IT Advisory: Update on Transferring Clients (TOC) to Other Service Points

September 27, 2024

Hi All,

The transfer of clients to other service points is allowed from October 1-7, 2024. Please coordinate with IT support representatives in your assigned division to endorse consolidated branches with pending transfer requests. Only approved branches will receive the TOC template via Google Sheets from the team

Deadline: September 28, 2024 (6:00 PM)
Distribution: September 29, 2024 (6:00 PM)

It is recommended that the AVP consolidate the requests and send it to the designated IT support representative.

Guidelines for correct encoding, including details of accounts that need to be journaled in the system, are provided in a separate sheet.

Thank you for your cooperation.
