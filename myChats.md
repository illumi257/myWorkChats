IT Advisory: Reminder for Month-End Report for September 2024

October 1, 2024

Dear All,

Branches are permitted to open the system for October 1 transactions without delaying the next day's operations, provided that the DCS for September 30 is closed and there is no COH adjustment.

AAs are responsible for ensuring balanced reports for all their assigned branches.

Please follow these reminders for month-end preparations:

Step 1: Daily Journal vs DCS (Ensure variances are zero).
Step 2: Financial Statement (Must be balanced).
Step 3: Dashboard vs FIS (Ensure variances are zero, except for Unclaimed Returns/Dormant Accounts).
Step 4:  To activate the Save Report button in FS, Go to "Manage Checking" component under Monitoring module, make sure that all criterion must be met .

Step 5: If Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 are balanced, click Save Report to finalize the closing of the financial statement (top-right corner).

Note: "Save Report" confirms that all books have been balanced and closed.


Important:
Do NOT click Save Report in FS if all books are not balanced and reconciled.

Regarding the Bank's Monthly Interest:
The interest will be recorded in the following month or the first week of October unless otherwise specified in the bankbook with a concurrent date. If the interest is already recorded in the bankbook by September 30, 2024, include it in the DCS (while it remains open). Otherwise, do not add it if DCS is closed. Ensure the Bank Balance in the system matches the actual balance in the branch bank book.

For assistance, please contact your CAMS support representative for technical issues and the MIS team for any unmatched accounts.

Thank you for your cooperation.
