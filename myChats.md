Good Evening Ma'am/Sir,

Subject: Incident Report in B0581 Balaoan
Date: July 31,2024

This is to report the transaction happened in B0581 Balaoan. 

Client of MFO4 in Red group, SL# 2 MARISSA VALDEZ has double microbusiness (46) . The client released on July 31,2024 but the supposed full payment on her previous loan was encoded on her new loan. The staff mislook that the loan product  was doubled since the loan amount is the same. We apologized and promise to be more cautious in our transactions.

CAMS Correct Data 
Type of Loan: Microbusiness (46)
Amount (w/SC): 57500
Loan Balance: 56250
Release date: July 31,2024
Group: Red
SL# : 2

Dear All,

We are grateful for your effort and congratulations to everyone for our prompt reports generation at the end of the month of July 2024 using CAMS (First month FS reconciliation).

The July 2024 FS report is now reconciled. CAMS FS CO and FS Branch are matched. Operational Update will be sent on or before Monday August 12, 2024. Because, IT team is still working and finalizing the deliquency account module (No affect in  FS).

Moreover, I'm still anticipating errors and delays made by branches on their day-to-day transactions because all of us are in the learning stage process. 

With this, all AAs are advised of the following daily monitoring after DCS closing.

- Daily Journal vs DCS, must be the primary module to balance.
- Adjustment Journal is use for variances shown in the Daily Journal vs DCS.
- After balancing of the Daily Journal vs DCS, financial statement is the next module to check.  (Coordinate the MIS team for the Interchange Account Title before reaching out to CAMS team).
- Non-cash journal is use for non-cash transactions such as:
	1.TDA
	2.Salary Disbursed
	3.Staff Transfer
	4. Consumed Rental Deposit

Note: Do not use cash on hand in the non-cash journal. But,  prior to the transaction they must consult the MIS team first on proper posting.

Thus, all concerns and feedback using the CAMs must be sent here for proper and immediate action by our IT team and also be known by others within the operations, as the first hand users. Every common error encountered by the branches and supervisors during their checking must be taken down notes for reference to never commit the same errors again using the system.

Again, maraming salamat!
Kudos to all for our reports generation.

Good day and keep safe everyone!

ADVISORY AND REMINDERS FOR THE MONTH END REPORTS  AUGUST 31, 2024 ON CAMS FS SAVED REPORTS

Dear AVPs Operations,

As previously advised, AAs are responsible for producing balanced reports for all branches under their supervision. 

The following are the reminders for month-end preparations:

Step 1. Daily Journal vs DCS (variances must be zero).

Step 2. Financial Statement (must balance)

Step 3. Dashboard vs FIS (variances must be zero except for Unclaimed Returns and Dormant Accounts).

Step 4. If steps 1,2 & 3 are balanced, click "Save Report" as final closing of financial statement (right uppermost).
"Save Report it means that all books have been balanced and closed."

STRONG ADVISORY ON FS SAVED REPORTS AUGUST 2024

Dear AVPs Operations,

Despite of numrrous reminders, that before saving FS reports, they must coordinate first both MIS and CAMS suppprt team. This is to check if the branch is balanced and reconciled. 

Moreover, FS SAVINGS REPORTS IS CRUCIAL. What if there are still adjustments that are not yet posted and transacted.  And now, it is happening. The branch saved report without transacting and checking the 5% 1601E (rent base) and others. So please do it so, AAs coordination is a must.

Please be guided accordingly and advisory must be follow without fail.
Your cooperation is essential for these month-end reports.

Maraming salamat sa continued support, patience, understanding, and cooperation.

CONGRATULATIONS EVERYONE👏🏼

Dear All,

We are grateful for your efforts and congratulations to everyone for our prompt reports generation at the 5th day after the month end date.

August 2024 FS report is now reconciled.  New at a glance operational update will be sent later.

With this, every branch level SHALL saved REPORTS shown in the BRANCH ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT MODULE > Financial Statements >Month >Year 2024. Please file it in the folder named "2024 FS Monthly Reports".

Take note: The folder name is 2024 FS MONTHLY REPORTS and the file name is 08_2024 B0001 Caloocan City I FS. Better to start the month and year for name sort purposes. This electronic copy in pdf format is filed in the branch desktop.

Maraming salamat for the cooperation, patience, and understanding. Kudos to all💪🏼

IT Advisory: CAMS Workflow Update - Financing Approvals

September 8, 2024 1930H

Hi All,

CAMS system has added a workflow to improve financing approvals. According to the Operational Guidebook 2024, Section 04, "Financing Programs," Article 10, page 71, financing approvals must adhere to the following guidelines:

Approval Authorities:
- Microfinance Officer (Upgraded to BM): ₱1,000 to ₱30,000
- Branch Managers: ₱31,000 to ₱50,000
- Area Administrators: ₱52,000 to ₱150,000
- Regional Administrators: ₱152,000 to ₱200,000
- Assistant Vice President: ₱202,000 to ₱300,000

Please note that all loan applications from the mobile app or eMFOR are subject to these approval guidelines.

To View Pending Loans:
- Go to CAMS > Branch Transactions > Loan Proceeds
- Here, you can filter by status, branch number, branch type, officers, etc.

Financing applications will not be processed until approved by the designated authorities. Upon approval, the amount will be recorded in both the financing module and DCS and will generate journal entries in the general journals. These entries must be posted before they can be displayed in FDMR and printed.

For any questions, please contact your CAMS support representative.

Thank you for your cooperation.

IT Advisory: CAMS Workflow Update

New Member On-boarding and Profile Adjustment Procedure

September 16, 2024

Hi All,

Please be advised of the following updates to the CAMS workflow:

1. New Member On-boarding:
The approval process for newly admitted clients has been moved to the Client Approval Management Module. This change ensures that the approving authority has adequate time to verify the validity and accuracy of all data entered by MicroFinance Officers (MFOs) before granting final approval. The onboarding status will now reflect newly endorsed clients.

2. Profile Adjustment: 
The second security upgrade involves monitoring changes to a client's primary information. Ensure adherence to the following approval hierarchy:

   - MFO > AA > RA > AVP
   - AA > RA > AVP
   - RA > AVP

For assistance, please contact your CAMS support representative in your designated division.

Thank you for your cooperation.

September 22, 2024

Hi All,

Following the list of enhancements, tasks, and wishes proposed by operations and independent departments, we are pleased to announce that the following features are now available in the system:

1. Cashbook
2. Collection Rate
3. COH & CIB Monitoring
4. Closing Approval Management
5. Branch Performance with Daily Archiving

Cashbook: This module records all cash-related transactions, including receipts, disbursements, and bank activities. Access it under Accounting Management > Monitoring.

Collection Rate: The branch recovery collection rate is monitored daily.

COH & CIB Monitoring: Previously used by senior management, this module is now accessible to operations with role-based limits. Find it under the General Report module.

Closing Approval Management: Endorsements for closing client accounts, including various closure types like Regular, Due to death, and Write-off, are now managed in this separate module.

Branch Performance: This module tracks daily branch metrics such as CBU, LCBU, loans, new members, closed accounts, releases, and delinquencies. To view the daily archiving list, click on the Day & Date title (e.g., Friday, Sep 20, 2024).

For any queries, please contact your designated CAMS support representative in your division.
